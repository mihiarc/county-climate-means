U.S. Regional Climate Data Alignment Validation Summary
============================================================

This validation checks that climate data rasters are properly
aligned with the defined regional boundaries.

What to look for:
- Climate data should fill the red dashed boundary rectangle
- No significant gaps between data and coastlines
- Temperature patterns should make geographic sense
- Data coverage should match expected region extent
